        Professional Go teachers will attend the 2021 U.S. Go Congress. As the
        list of attending Pros is created, descriptions of them will appear on
        this webpage.
      welcome: >
        The U.S. Go Congress is the largest go activity in the United States. It
        happens once a year and spans one week. Events include the U.S. Open,
        the largest annual go tournament in the U.S., professional lectures and
        game analysis, continuous self-paired games, and all kinds of go-related
        activities from morning to midnight. Come for the go. Come for the
        camaraderie of old friends. Whatever your reason, we are looking forward
        to seeing you there.
      volunteers: >
        From **tournament directors** to the people who volunteer **only a few
        hours at the front desk**, we need your help.  The Go Congress would not
        be possible without the dedication of dozens of volunteers.  Please
        email the congress directors to volunteer at this yearâ€™s congress.
        Thanks!
