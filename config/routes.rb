        # ## Devise routes
        #
        # It's a bit confusing that `sign_ups` is both the name of our
        # `Devise::RegistrationsController` controller, and a routing path, as
        # in `/sign_ups/confirmations`. We might want to consider the following
        # configuration, which is more traditional:
        #
        # ```
        # devise_for :users,
        #   controllers: {
        #     confirmations: 'users/confirmations',
        #     registrations: 'users/registrations'
        #   }
        # ```
        #
        # This would pose a new problem, however. We would have both a
        # `users/registrations` controller, and a `registrations` controller.
        # This is probably why we adopted the term "sign ups" in the first
        # place.
